this project was a part of COMP 589 - Software Metrics course

Summary: 

The UI module facilitates the collection of city and date-time information from the user and utilizes the Google Maps API to obtain the lat-long coordinates corresponding to the city. Subsequently, it presents a simulated animation depicting the earthquake and provides information regarding the magnitude and depth of the seismic event.
The ML module employs earthquake datasets and applies Machine Learning techniques to train a prediction model that estimates the magnitude and depth of earthquake events based on the user-entered location details in the UI module.
The Simulation module generates an animation illustrating the destruction of a building, taking into account various magnitudes generated by the ML Module. This animation is then rendered as a video on the user interface.
